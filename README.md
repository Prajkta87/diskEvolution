# Introduction

This is a project to port a disk evolution simulation to java.

A team of undergraduate researchers at Arizona State University
is working with Prof. Shumway in Physics and
Prof. Desch in Astrophysics to implement this simulation tool in Java.
The work is based on algorithms and Fortran codes used by Prof. Desch
and graduate students Mike Lesniak (Ph. D. 2012) and Nikhil Monga.

# Building and running the application

To build and run the project:

1. Download the source using git or from a zip file.
2. Run ant from the source directory.

    ant jar
3. Run with “ant run” or the run script.

    bash runApp.sh
